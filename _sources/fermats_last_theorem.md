The proposition was first stated as a theorem by Pierre de Fermat around 1637 in the margin of a copy of Arithmetica. Fermat added that he had a proof that was too large to fit in the margin. Although other statements claimed by Fermat without proof were subsequently proven by others and credited as theorems of Fermat (for example, Fermat's theorem on sums of two squares), Fermat's Last Theorem resisted proof, leading to doubt that Fermat ever had a correct proof.
```{margin} Did you know?
It took the humanity 358 years to solve this problem
```

The statement of the problem is that, there is no integer number: n greater than 2 for the following equation to hold where a, b and c are positive integers
```{math}
:label: eq_label3

a^n + b^n = c^n
```


```{Tip}
The case n = 2 is the famous Pythagorean Theorem
```

Equation {eq}`eq_label3` is an expression of the Basel Problem

```{note}
There is a connection between this problem and the Elliptic Curve
```

Elliptic Curve
```{math}
:label: eq_label4
y^2 = x^3 + Ax + B
```

Equation {eq}`eq_label4` is one expression of Elliptic Curve

 After 358 years of effort by mathematicians, the first successful proof was released in 1994 by Andrew Wiles and formally published in 1995.
