The Basel problem is a problem in mathematical analysis with relevance to number theory, concerning an infinite sum of inverse squares. It was first posed by Pietro Mengoli in 1650 and solved by Leonhard Euler in 1734, and read on 5 December 1735 in The Saint Petersburg Academy of Sciences.
```{margin} Did you know?
The Basel Problem is a special case of the Eulerâ€“Riemann zeta function
```

```{math}
:label: eq_label

\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2} = \frac{1}{1^2} + \frac{1}{2^2} + \frac{1}{3^2} + \cdots = \frac {\pi^2}{6}
```


```{Warning}
This is a test!
```

Equation {eq}`eq_label` is an expression of the Basel Problem

```{Tip}
This equation can be used to estimate the value of pi
```

```{math}
:label: eq_label2
\pi = \sqrt[]{6\times \left( \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{1}{x^2}\right)}
```

Equation {eq}`eq_label2` will be used next page
